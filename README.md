# Marca

Minimal extensible markup language.

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys.

## TODO

* more proper parser w/ error reporting;
* elementProtos as schema, maybe dynamic?
* namespaces? stacking of namespaces?
* overlapping markup? (marca-hypertext-highlight)
* better API for element creation? (marca-hypertext-highlight)
* generic post-processing? (marca-hypertext-highlight)
* dynamic tag definitions a la LaTeX? file includes? (marca-math)
* different kinds of attribute propagation and default attrs? (marca-math)
* browserification;
* API review;
* documentation;
* tests.
